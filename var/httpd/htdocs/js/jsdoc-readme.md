# Documentation of OTRS JavaScript-Namespaces

This is the documentation of all JavaScript namespaces used in OTRS Helpdesk. The information
is automatically extracted from the JavaScript source files of [the master branch](https://github.com/OTRS/otrs/tree/master).

If you find any error or inconsistency, please feel free to fix the issue and send us a pull request!

We are glad about all contributions that you may want to make. Please note that you need to accept the
[OTRS contributor agreement (CLA)](http://otrs.github.io/files/OTRS%20Contributor%20Agreement.pdf) once.
This effectively means that you transfer the copyright of the code
to OTRS â€” see [this blog entry](http://julien.ponge.org/blog/in-defense-of-contributor-license-agreements/)
for a discussion of when and why it is good for open source projects to
use a CLA. Please print and sign this document and [send us the scan](mailto:cla@otrs.com?subject=Signed%20OTRS%20CLA)
and your github username.
